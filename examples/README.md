This directory contains samples and examples code of object's usage.

To test them :
1. copy the example file (like "*Page.cpp*") in **Test** directory.
2. compile using well configured Arduino IDE

Notez-bien : Provided *Test.ino* is made for [Lilygo's LilyPI](http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?TypeId=50032&Id=1353&FId=t3:50032:3) but can be easily configured for other devices.
