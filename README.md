# emToile
Lvgl based framework to build GUI on **Arduino IDE** compatible embedded systems

## installation

Clone this repository in your **Arduino IDE libraries** directory (i.e. ``~/Arduino/libraries``)

[lvgl](https://lvgl.io/) is expected to be installed and accessible thru "lvgl/" include sub directory (it's the case if you're using [Xinyuan-LilyGO /TTGO_TWatch_Library](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/TTGO_TWatch_Library)

## Documentation (lack of)

Each header file is an implementation of an Lvgl object and contains related usage documentation.

[Toile](https://github.com/destroyedlolo/Toile) is a framework to build GUIs on Unix system using **Lua**. **emToile** has the same goal for embedded systems but not using Lua. It's why I choose the change sightly the name and create a dedicated directory.
